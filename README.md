# Project-Kiddo

Project-Kiddo was a short puzzle-solving game developed by 6 students as part of a small game-project course. It was built from the ground up in C++ to learn the basics of both project work and OpenGL.

The goal of the game is to recover the lost teddybear hidden in this mysterious world. The player achieves this by pushing boxes onto various devices such as buttons. This opens up further access to different parts of the map so the player can advance towards the end.
